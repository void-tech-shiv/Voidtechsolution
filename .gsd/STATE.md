# Project State — VOIDTECH SOLUTION

## Current Position

**Milestone:** 10.1 — CMS Database Schema & Content Repositories (Task 10.1.5.2 COMPLETE)
**Phase:** 10 — Admin CMS
**Status:** active (Phase 10.1 In Progress: Task 10.1.5.2 — Production Visual Integrity & Release Readiness Audit complete. Diagnosed and resolved the root cause of the localhost:3000 unstyled appearance; verified that dev server was crashing with fractured module maps and CSS 404 due to stale .next production build artifacts; implemented cross-platform pre-dev clean safeguard in package.json; unified tailwind.config.ts content scanning; authored and verified automated 49-case Playwright visual release gate across 7 viewports [320px–1920px] and 7 critical routes; 642/642 Vitest tests pass; 0 typecheck errors, 0 lint errors, 33/33 Next.js routes built cleanly. Production Neon completely untouched and isolated)
**Visual Reference:** SmartStruct Cybernetic Layout + Official Purple/Violet Brand Identity  

## Last Action

- Executed Task 10.1.5.2 — Production Visual Integrity & Release Readiness Audit:
  - Authored audit report: `docs/phases/PHASE_10_1_5_2_PRODUCTION_VISUAL_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md`.
  - Updated `package.json`: added cross-platform build/dev cache safeguard to `"dev"` script, added `"test:gate"` release gate check.
  - Updated `tailwind.config.ts`: unified content array to `"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"`.
  - Created `tests/e2e/production-visual-integrity.spec.ts` testing 49 permutations (7 viewports x 7 routes), asserting 200 OK stylesheets, computed CSS custom properties, Inter/sans-serif typography, styled CTA buttons, zero horizontal scroll overflow, and zero unhandled console errors.
  - Verified 49/49 visual integrity release gate tests pass (100% pass rate).
  - Verified 22/22 screenshot proof tests pass (100% pass rate).
  - Verified full test regression: 642/642 Vitest tests pass across 45 test files.
  - Verified compilation: `npm run typecheck` (0 errors), `npm run lint` (0 errors/warnings), `next build` (33/33 production routes).
  - Verified git whitespace: `git diff --check` passed cleanly.
  - Maintained strict database safety: production Neon was never accessed, contacted, migrated, or modified.

## Next Steps

1. Present Task 10.1.5.2 Final Completion Report to Owner with PASS verdict.
2. Await Owner Authorization before beginning Task 10.1.6 (9-Step Atomic Publishing Transaction Engine).
